Very Little Wire device module.

The module provides a Python interface to the Little Wire USB Multi-Tool
developed by Ihsan Kehribar.

This file is a direct Python translation of the C/C++ library developed by Ihsan
Kehribar <ihsan@kehribar.me> and Omer Kilic <omerkilic@gmail.com>. The C/C++
library was released under the same license. Adam Johnson did the translation
based on the C/C++ library version 0.9 for Python 2. This new reimplementation
is an effort to port the Python 2 translation to Python 3 and adapt the changes
in the C/C++ library from version 0.9 to the latest version 1.2.
